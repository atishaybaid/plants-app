            "description": "The Rubber Plant, Ficus elastica, stands out with its striking large, glossy, dark green leaves, lending an elegant touch to indoor spaces. To ensure its well-being, place it in bright, indirect light, avoiding direct sun to prevent leaf damage. Maintain soil moisture by allowing the top layer to dry between waterings, preventing root rot. Moderate to high humidity levels suit this plant, achieved through occasional misting or a humidifier, while consistent temperatures without sudden fluctuations are ideal. Regular pruning helps manage its size and promote new growth, and keeping an eye out for pests like spider mites and mealybugs ensures its health. Remember, it's toxic to pets if ingested, so position it away from curious furry friends. Adhering to these care measures will maintain the Rubber Plant's stunning appearance and robust growth indoors.",
            "careTips": "Provide your rubber plant with bright, indirect light, allowing the top inch of soil to dry between waterings to prevent overwatering and root rot. Moderate to high humidity levels are beneficial, but it adapts to average household conditions. Ensure well-draining soil and occasional pruning to maintain its shape and size. Watch for pests like spider mites and mealybugs, wiping the leaves periodically. Keep it away from direct drafts and cold temperatures. Remember, it's toxic to pets if ingested, so place it out of their reach. With this care routine, your rubber plant should thrive beautifully indoors.",

They thrive in bright, indirect sunlight, requiring well-draining soil to avoid waterlogging. Keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy. Crotons prefer warm temperatures and benefit from occasional misting to provide moderate humidity levels. Watch for spider mites and scale insects, as they can be prone to infestations. Regular pruning helps maintain their compact and bushy appearance."

They do well in bright, indirect light but can tolerate lower light conditions. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, ensuring adequate drainage. Areca palms appreciate higher humidity levels, so occasional misting or using a humidifier is beneficial, especially in drier climates. Regularly remove any brown or yellowing fronds to maintain its appearance."
